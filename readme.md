# Sprint Cup

## Overview

This app aims to solve 2 problems. It will be a tool to encourage good coding culture and promote socialisation within your teams. Users will have the opportunity to create a _League_ and add other users to it. Within that league there will be certain _fines_ and _rewards_ which all members can give to each other.

eg if someone were to do a teach back on a particular topic to the team then they would receive a reward from one of their peers. Or if they were to push code to the repo without writing tests for it then they would receive a fine from their peers.

The fines and rewards will be tracked and at the end-of-sprint meeting ( generally 2 weeks ) there will be a fun social "fines meeting". This is an opportunity to share a drink with your team-mates and discuss what went wrong and what went well that term. The different members will also be held accountable for the points they have accrued, which will relate to the drink of their choice. ie not writing tests for your feature will result in a fine of 3 sips of beer.
